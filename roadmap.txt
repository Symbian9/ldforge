== LDFORGE ROADMAP
================================================================================

-----------------------------
-- Alpha 1

REQUIRED:
	- Do some testing to ensure that there's nothing horribly broken or misssing
	- [Ext progs] Isecalc support. It's already half-done...
	- [Ext progs] failure recovery

RECOMMENDED:
	- [Ext progs] Coverer, Edger2, SlicerPro interfaces
	- [Viewport] Compile selected entries beforehand, this way picking doesn't need
		any recompiling and will probably be a lot faster.

DONE:
	- [Plane draw] Get the thing working for non-top cameras.

-----------------------------
-- Alpha 2

REQUIRED:
	- Undo/redo stability

RECOMMENDED:
	- [Plane draw] Option support: rectangle, line loop, circle, ellipse?, disc
	- [Viewport] Vertex drawing and selection, if possible..
	- [Color selector] Rewrite the viewport, don't use QPen for color edges!

SUGGESTED:
	- [Radials] Ring covering?

-----------------------------
-- Stable 1.0

REQUIRED:
	- Anything that crashes the thing has to be obviously fixed.

SUGGESTED:
	- Texture mapping? Probably best to leave this off until future versions.
