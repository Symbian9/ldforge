=================================================
== Changes in version 0.3-alpha
=================================================
- Multiple files can now be kept open at the same time. A new list widget is on the left to contain the list
	of currently open files.
		- Added close, close all and save all actions.
- Added ability to download parts from the Parts Tracker or from a custom-specified URL. If the resulting
	file contains references to unknown files, LDForge attempts to recursively download all of them.
- Converted the configuration code to use QSettings, in practice this means the configuration file moved to
	the registry under Windows and into ~/.config/LDForge under Linux. Unfortunately this means settings get
	lost during transition from version 0.2 and 0.3.
- Added a new editing mode for drawing circles.
- Major corrections to the primitive generator:
	- Fixed: "Hi-Res" was not prepended to the names of 48/ primitives.
	- Fixed: Checking the Hi-Res option would not allow segment values over 16.
	- Added support for multiple spaces before the ring number.
- Coordinate rounding now works properly, figures scientific notation and rounds subfile position and matrix.
	Values are also now properly rounded instead of just floored, 1.2348 now rounds to 1.235 and not 1.234.
	Subfile matrix values are rounded to 4 decimals, everything else to 3 decimals.
- Implicitely-opened documents are now closed automatically when rendered unused, hopefully reducing memory
	usage somewhat.
- Changing to draw mode while in free camera now causes the camera to be changed to top.
- Added config fields for default name/username/license. This data will be automatically filled
	into forms that require such information.
- Upon first start the configuration prompt pops up on its own, defaulting on the profile tab. This
	way the user can fill in the profile data on the first start and get that out of the way (and
	gives the opportunity to see the other config fields)
- Added new action "Add History Line" for quickly inserting 0 !HISTORY lines to headers
- Added new action "Go to line", default shortcut Ctrl-G. It should be obvious what it does.
- Added new actions "Hide" and "Reveal" which allow direct setting of objects' visibility setting instead of
	toggling it.
- Added support for logoed studs, this should satisfy Steffen. :p
- Added support for '0 BFC CLIP' and '0 BFC NOCLIP' and added auto-correction from errorneous MLCAD
	syntax ('0 BFC CERTIFY CLIP').
- The viewport now uses 7 sets of rotation/pan/zoom values, one for each camera. Changing these values
	in one camera no longer affects other cameras.
- When an external program is attempted to be used without a binary path defined, one will be asked
	with an input dialog instead of being told to go to configuration to set the path.
- When adding edges with Intersector (which is done with Isecalc), the user is prompted for Isecalc's
	path now as well if necessary instead of just ignoring it and not adding the edgelines.
- Added a configuration option for line anti-aliasing.
- BFC red/green view and black edges no longer default to true.
- If the vertex snapper finds a vertex closer than 4 pixels, it likely is the vertex being looked for
	and the algorithm can terminate early, hopefully this will save a few cycles on large parts.
- The camera icons now draw real tooltips instead of emulated ones.
- Color icon border now reflects the color's edge color.
- Fixed: File loading would skip every 300th line.
- Fixed: LDForge would sometimes crash during startup over uninitialized data in the GL renderer.
- Fixed: The message log was still written with black text with dark backgrounds.

=================================================
== Changes in version 0.2-alpha
=================================================

- Completely rewrote history (undo/redo) code, making it a LOT stabler in the process.
- Added ability to snap to pre-existing vertices while drawing.
- Replaced the radial type with a single action to generate primitives.
- Replaced parts list in subfile item list with a primitive listing. Listing is generated either if
	it's not cached (prims.cfg in configuration directory) or on user demand. Primitives can be categorised
	with the use of a regex-based configuration file, with a valid default which should cater to most users.
- Added an export to file action, moved it + insert from to File menu
- Added the message log - instead of being a separate text widget as originally planned, messages are
	drawn into the viewport. Messages expire after 5 seconds.
- Parts are now zoomed to fit properly, making the initial view of the part clearer.
- Replace coords: allow replacing all coords regardless of original value, plus relative moving (offset)
- Objects can now be edited by double-clicking on them.
- When drawing, drawn vertices now display coordinate labels.
- Added an action to quickly toggle BFC red/green view.
- Objects are now copied to the system clipboard as LDraw code, rather than to an internal clipboard not
	accessible outside of LDForge.
- Changed default keys for Y-axis moving from PgUp/PgDown to Home and End ala MLCAD.
- Cleaned up the toolbars, removed clutter by removing most of the not-so-often-used items, though of course
	the functionality is still available through menus and keyboard shortcuts.
- [Linux] External programs can now be launched with Wine.
- Improved external program fault handling: don't try to replace/append the output in case of failure, catch non-zero exit codes.
- Added a progress box for file loading to respond to desktops while loading files. With large files
	the no-response policy could be a bad thing.
- Color selector is now twice as wide for easier color selection.
- Fixed: Recent files should behave coherently now.
- Fixed: Overlays could only be defined for the current camera, changing the camera in the prompt didn't work.
- Fixed: text editing did not trigger checks while setting LDraw path, removed the Configure
	button from the LDraw path config dialog, it's no longer needed.
- Fixed: Coordinates weren't drawn properly on a bright background (was always drawn in bright colors..).
- Renamed "Set Contents" into "Edit LDraw Code", should be clearer
- Changed the green color to more "greener" green, rather than yellowish lime.
- The dialog box for setting a comment's text is now a lot wider
- Calculated coordinates are now rounded down (to prevent stuff like Z:160.000001)
- New part dialog: changed "Name:" to "Title", widened a tad.
