You need Qt4 or Qt5 with OpenGL and networking support. On Debian and
derivatives, e.g. Ubuntu, you'll need:
	sudo apt-get install build-essential libqt4-dev libqt4-opengl-dev
		libqt4-network

You may also replace qt4 with qt5 in the above for Qt5.

To compile:
-	enter the root directory
-	enter 'qmake'
-	enter 'make release' or 'make debug'. A release build is made by default.

Troubleshooting:
- src/gldraw.h:22:21: fatal error: QGLWidget: No such file or directory
You are missing the OpenGL development package, on Debian and derivatives,
this is libqt4-opengl-dev or libqt5-opengl-dev.
