 * Implements a ring adapter over T. This class corrects indices given to the element-operator so that they're within bounds.
 * The maximum amount can be specified manually.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *   int A[] = {10,20,30,40};
 *   ring(A)[0]  ==     A[0 % 4]    == A[0]
 *   ring(A)[5]  ==     A[5 % 4]    == A[1]
 *   ring(A)[-1] == ring(A)[-1 + 4] == A[3]
