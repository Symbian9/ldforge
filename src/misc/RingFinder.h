//! @brief Provides an algorithm for finding solutions of rings between given radii.
//!
//! The RingFinder is a class which implements a ring finding algorithm. It is passed
//! two radii and it tries to find solutions of rings that would fill the given space.
//!
//! @note It is not fool-proof and does not always yield a solution, never assume
//! @note that one is a available as none is guaranteed.
//!
class RingFinder
{
	public:
		//! A single component in a solution
		struct Component
		{
			int num;
			double scale;
		};

		//! A solution whose components would fill the desired ring space.
		class Solution
		{
			public:
				//! @returns components of this solution
				inline const QVector<Component>& getComponents() const
				{
					return m_components;
				}

				//! Add a component to this solution
				inline void addComponent (const Component& a)
				{
					m_components.push_back (a);
				}

				//! @brief Compare solutions.
				//!
				//! Compares this solution with @c other and determines which
				//! one is superior.
				//!
				//! A solution is considered superior if solution has less
				//! components than the other one. If both solution have an
				//! equal amount components, the solution with a lesser maximum
				//! ring number is found superior, as such solutions should
				//! yield less new primitives and cleaner definitions.
				//!
				//! The solution which is found superior to every other solution
				//! will be the one returned by @c RingFinder::bestSolution().
				//!
				//! @param other the solution to check against
				//! @returns whether this solution is considered superior
				//! @returns to @c other.
				//!

		//! @brief Tries to find rings between @c r0 and @c r1.
		//!
		//! This is the main algorithm of the ring finder. It tries to use math
		//! to find the one ring between r0 and r1. If it fails (the ring number
		//! is non-integral), it finds an intermediate radius (ceil of the ring
		//! number times scale) and splits the radius at this point, calling this
		//! function again to try find the rings between r0 - r and r - r1.
		//!
		//! This does not always yield into usable results. If at some point r ==
		//! r0 or r == r1, there is no hope of finding the rings, at least with
		//! this algorithm, as it would fall into an infinite recursion.
		//!
		//! @param r0 the lower radius of the ring space
		//! @param r1 the higher radius of the ring space
		//! @returns whether it was possible to find a solution for the given
		//! @returns ring space.
		//!
		bool findRings (double r0, double r1);

		//! @returns the solution that was considered best. Returns @c null
		//! @returns if no suitable solution was found.
		//! @see @c RingFinder::Solution::isSuperiorTo()
		inline const Solution* bestSolution()
		{
			return m_bestSolution;
		}

		//! @returns all found solutions. The list is empty if no solutions
		//! @returns were found.
